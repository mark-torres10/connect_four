# Minimax Algorithm for Connect Four

This document outlines the plan for implementing a Minimax algorithm to create an AI opponent for the Connect Four game.

## 1. Algorithm Overview

The Minimax algorithm is a recursive algorithm used for choosing the optimal move for a player, assuming that the opponent also plays optimally. It is a decision-making algorithm that is used in two-player turn-based games.

## 2. Core Components

### a. Game State Evaluation

- We need a function to evaluate the game state from the perspective of the AI player.
- This function will assign a score to the board based on how favorable it is for the AI.
- The scoring will be based on the number of pieces in a row, with a higher score for more pieces in a row.
- A winning state for the AI will have a very high score (e.g., +infinity), and a winning state for the human player will have a very low score (e.g., -infinity).

### b. Recursive Minimax Function

- This function will take the current board state, the depth of the search, and the current player as input.
- It will recursively explore the game tree to a certain depth.
- For each possible move, it will call itself with the new board state and the other player.
- It will return the best score for the current player.

### c. Alpha-Beta Pruning

- To optimize the Minimax algorithm, we will implement alpha-beta pruning.
- This will allow us to prune branches of the game tree that we know will not lead to a better outcome.
- This will significantly reduce the number of nodes we need to evaluate, making the AI much faster.

## 3. Implementation Steps

1.  **Create the evaluation function:** This function will take the board and a player as input and return a score.
2.  **Implement the recursive Minimax function:** This will be the core of the AI.
3.  **Integrate the AI into the game:** We will add a new game mode where the player can play against the AI.
4.  **Add alpha-beta pruning:** This will optimize the AI's performance.
